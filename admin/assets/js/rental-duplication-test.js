/**
 * RENTAL DUPLICATION PREVENTION SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
 * 
 * FIXED ISSUES:
 * ✅ Stock calculation now uses actual product quantities instead of rental count
 * ✅ Added debug function to troubleshoot availability issues
 * ✅ Improved rental quantity tracking in getExistingRentals
 * ✅ Added detailed logging for availability checks
 * 
 * BEFORE FIX:
 * - System was counting number of rental records
 * - If 1 rental existed, it would subtract 1 from total stock
 * - This caused false "limited availability" warnings
 * 
 * AFTER FIX:
 * - System now counts actual product quantities in each rental
 * - If a rental has 2 items of size XL, it subtracts 2 from available stock
 * - Only shows warnings when actual stock conflicts exist
 * 
 * This system prevents rental conflicts by implementing the following features:
 * 
 * 1. STOCK CHECKING:
 *    - Products cannot be rented if stock is insufficient
 *    - Stock is dynamically calculated based on existing rentals
 *    - Reduces available stock by actual quantity for each active rental
 * 
 * 2. DATE CONFLICT PREVENTION:
 *    - Fixed Rental: If event date is June 23, product is unavailable on:
 *      * June 23 (event date)
 *      * June 24 (day after)
 *      * June 25 (second day after) 
 *      * June 26 (cleaning day)
 * 
 *    - Open Rental: If start date is June 23 and end date is June 24:
 *      * June 23 (start date)
 *      * June 24 (end date)
 *      * June 25 (cleaning day)
 * 
 * 3. NOTIFICATION SYSTEM:
 *    - Notyf notifications alert users when products are already rented
 *    - Real-time availability checking when dates change
 *    - Warnings during checkout process
 * 
 * 4. INTEGRATION POINTS:
 *    - Product selection (before adding to cart)
 *    - Cart checkout (before showing customer form)
 *    - Date changes (real-time availability checking)
 *    - Form submission (final validation)
 * 
 * FILES MODIFIED:
 * - rental.html: Added rental-duplication.js script import
 * - rental-subscript.js: Integrated availability checking functions
 * - rental-duplication.js: Fixed stock calculation logic and added debug function
 * 
 * DEBUGGING:
 * - Added debugProductAvailability() function
 * - Console logs show detailed availability information
 * - Check browser console for debug output when issues occur
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * The system automatically prevents conflicts without requiring manual intervention.
 * Users will see error notifications only when actual conflicts exist.

// Test scenarios to verify the system works:
console.log('Rental Duplication System Test Scenarios:');
console.log('1. Try to rent the same product/size twice');
console.log('2. Select rental dates that conflict with existing rentals');
console.log('3. Check if stock decreases when products are rented');
console.log('4. Verify cleaning day buffer is added to rental periods');
console.log('5. Debug availability issues using debugProductAvailability()');

// Example usage:
// import { debugProductAvailability } from './rental-duplication.js';
// await debugProductAvailability('productId', 'XXL', '2025-06-23');
